Even with a roster change about halfway through the season, we tied for second place in the league bracket, unfortunately falling short in the tiebreaker to end up with a third place finish.

					<h4>A long time ago...</h4>
					<p>At the end of 2013, into the beginning of 2014, a few friends joined to together to start playing Dota on a decently competitive level for the first season of the joinDota League. Having mild success and securing a spot in division 4 for the next season, team "Falling With Style" pushed forward to start climbing the ranks.</p>
					<p>Most every season brought some form of change, from position swaps to roster changes.  Season 4 saw what was almost a disband of the entire squad, but after a last second roster addition, Falling With Style was reborn as Mastodon.</p>
					<p>Now we set our sights on growth: individually, as a team, and as brand.</p>
