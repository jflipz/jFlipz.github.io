		  <h3><span>joinDota League Season 6</span></h3>
          <br/>
		  <p>mtd.Dota2 is registered and practicing for the sixth season of the joinDota League.  We have played in all 5 previous seasons, consistely moving up through the divisions.  In season 1, we secured a spot in division 4 for season 2, where we placed 4th with some roster troubles.  In season 3 we qualified for the 3/4 playoffs, squeaking out a win in an almost 70 minute game to move into division 3.  Season 4 proved to be a difficult time for the team with a fair amount of drama and inevitable change, but we bounced back for season 5 and finished in a respectable 3rd place after losing the 2nd place tiebreaker.<br/>It's time for season 6.  This time we're confident we will be putting up a fight for division 2.  The roster is stable and solid, and we're pumped for competition heading into the spring and summer months.</p>

		    <h3><span>joinDota League Season 5C</span></h3>
            <br/>
		  	<p>Looking back at season 5, there was a little bit of disappointment, but a long of motivation to be taken from our results.  Considering the five man roster was completed after the first few games of the season, and we had another roster change mid season, we were happy with a 12-6 finish.<br/>There were definitely some games that we knew we should've won, games that were painfully close until the very end, and we did get absolutely stomped once or twice (thanks Istari).  All in all, we finished the group stage in second place behind an undefeated team.  Though we ended up losing the tiebreaker, we will be pushing to demolish the field in the upcoming season 6 of the joinDota League.</p>
